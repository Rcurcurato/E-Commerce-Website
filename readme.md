# E-Commerce-Database

## Description
Here you will find a database using get, post, put, and delete requests. To use this application first make sure you install insomnia.
Once you are in insomnia start the server with npm start. Now you can easily navigate the data base by sending a request to the server 
to get all of the data. You can also request to get specific data by searching by id. To do this put the specific id number after the url using 
/ and then the number. If you wish to create new data you can with a post request. If you wish to delete data you can also do that with delete
by putting the id number of what you want to delete after the url. You can also update data with the put request. For any more questions you 
can reach me at my email or github listed below.
